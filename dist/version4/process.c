init_regs

Each process has a state associated with it, in the form of CPU registers.
Whenever a context switch occurs and this process becomes the current one, the
registers are loaded from memory into the CPU. When a process is first created,
we must initialise these to the appropriate values, so that the processor will
start off in the right state when the process receives its first time slice.

get_free_pid

Finds the lowest unused process identifier. This is used when creating a new
process, when we need to obtain a slot in the processes array to use to store
the data associated with the new process. This function only checks for pids
greater than 0, since the fork system call (implemented in later versions of
the kernel) treats a return value of 0 specially.

start_process

Create a new process and add it to the list of ready processes. The first
parameter specifies the starting address, i.e. the point at which the CPU should
begin executing code when the process is first scheduled. In the simple case
where we do not have a way to load executable files from disk, this can just be
a pointer to a function defined in the kernel.

The process will not actually start immediately. This will only happen after it
gets scheduled as a result of a context switch. Since these happen 50 times per
second, the process will get its first time slice very shortly.

suspend_process

Mark a processes as suspended, so that it will not be considered by the
scheduler. Processes are suspended whenever they need to wait for some external
event to occur, e.g. the user entering some input. Suspension can also be used
to have processes sleep for a specified period of time, although this requires
additional logic in the scheduler which we have not implemented.

resume_process

Mark a process as ready, so that it will be eligible for execution, and given
time slices by the scheduler. This is usually called when an event that a
process has been waiting on occurs, e.g. some user input becomes available.

context_switch

Switch to another process. This is called by the timer interrupt handler, which
is fired 50 times per second. The current process is suspended, another one is
chosen from the ready list, and then this is activated.

There are a few special situations we need to handle here. We need to check upon
entry if there is actually a process running - if not, then we don't need to
save its state. This can be the case if the kernel has just started, or if all
processes are suspended. Also, if there are no processes to switch to, we must
cause the processor to go into an idle loop until one or more processes become
ready.

Upon return, this function ensures that the values in the register state pointed
to by r are that of the process being switch to. There is some inefficiency
here, because the registers must be copied twice (once in the interrupt handler,
and once here). However this is slightly simpler than maintaining a separate
kernel stack for each process.

     been suspended), then we can't use the next pointer, since this will point
     to the next process in the suspended list instead of the ready list.
     Instead, act as if there is no current process. */
