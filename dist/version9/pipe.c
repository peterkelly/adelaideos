the reading file handle and the writing file handle.

wake_up_reader

Wakes up a suspended process that was blocked on a read call that referenced
this pipe. This is called whenever some data is written to the pipe, or the pipe
is closed for writing. Once the process is resumed, the read system call will be
executed again, and either return some data to the calling process or indicate
end-of-file.

/*==============================================================================
write_to_pipe

Add some data to a pipe. If another process was blocked on a read call to this
pipe, it will subsequently be woken up and given the data it requested.

In our implementation, there is no limit on the amount of data that can be
stored in the pipe at any given time, though most operating systems do actually
place a limit on this, and force the writer to block until enough space is
available.

The reason for defining write_to_pipe as a separate function to
pipe_writer_write is so that it can be called from other parts of the kernel in
situations where the kernel itself is writing to the pipe, instead of another
process. An example of this can be seen in keyboard_handler, which writes
charcters entered by the user to a pipe that is connected to standard input of
the first process.

Free a pipe_buffer object if possible. This can only be done if it has been
closed for both reading *and* writing. This function is called whenever either
end of the pipe is closed.

is to call through to the write_to_pipe function to add the data.

of file handles are write-only, we simply return an error code here indicating
that an invalid operation has been requested on the file handle.

pipe_writer_destroy

Destroys a pipe writer file handle. This will also destroy the pipe itself, if
it is no longer being read from.

If there is another process blocked on a read call for the pipe at the time
that this function is called, then it will be resumed so that the read call can
try again. If the pipe was empty, then the read call will immediately see that
it is no longer being written to, and return 0 to the process. If there was data
left in the pipe, the reading process will still be able to get that data, but
of course no more will be placed in the buffer and it will get a 0 on a later
call to read.

new_pipe_writer

Creates a new file handle that can be used for writing to a pipe. This sets up
function pointers within the filehandle object that refer to the pipe_writer_*
functions defined above. These functions allow writing to the pipe, but not
reading from it.

Once this file handle has been created, it can be added to a process's file
descriptor table. This enables the process to write to the pipe by invoking the
write system call, and passing in the file descriptor that refers to this
handle. The process may *not* read from the pipe using this file handle, since
this is intended for write-only access.

For each pipe, there must be only a single file handle used for writing to it.
However, the file handle may be referenced from multiple file descriptors in
different processes.

pipe_reader_write

This function is used as the write handler for file handles of type
FH_PIPE_READER, and is invoked from the write system call.

Since these types of file handles are read-only, we simply return an error code
here indicating that an invalid operation has been requested on the file handle.
==============================================================================*/

{
  return -EINVAL;
}

/*==============================================================================
pipe_reader_read

This function is used as the read handler for file handles of type
FH_PIPE_READER, and is invoked from the read system call.

If there is data available in the pipe, then we can just return this to the
process and return immediately. An immedaite return is also possible if the pipe
is empty, but it is no longer being written to; this situation corresponds to
the end of file.

If neither of these two situations arise, then we must block here, since the
system call can't actually complete until either some more data becomes
available, or the pipe is closed for writing. In this case, we suspend the
current process. When the pipe is later written to or closed for writing, the
wake_up_reader function will resume the process, causing this function to be
called again. The second time round, either one of the first two cases will
match, and the system call can then return.

new_pipe_reader

Creates a file handle which can be used to read from a pipe. When this is added
to a process's file descriptor table, the process may read from the pipe by
invoking the read system call, and passing in the appropriate file descriptor.

For each pipe, there must be only a single file handle used for reading from it.

syscall_pipe

Implements the pipe system call. This creates a pipe, as well as two file
handles. The first file handle can be used for reading from the pipe, and the
second for writing to it. Both handles are then associated with file descriptors
in the current process's file descriptor table.

The most common use of this function is when a process is about to fork. A pipe
is created to allow the parent and child process to communicate. When the fork
occurs, the child inherits references to the pipe, and both sides release either
the reading or writing file descriptor, depending on the direction in which the
data is to flow. The pipe can then be used to transfer data from the parent to
the child, or vice-versa.
