Determine the actual block size to be used for a particular requested size. This

to figure out how much memory to actually allocate. The block size must be a
power of 2, and at least as big as the smallest level of granularity, which is

get_buddy

Calculate the address of the buddy of a block, for a given size. The reason why
we need to know the size is that a given block address can potentially have
multiple buddies - e.g. a block at 2mb could have a buddy at 0mb, or 2.5mb, or
2.25 mb etc. This is also the reason why we keep track of block sizes in the
blockinfo array.

Add the specified block to the free list of the given size. The buddy allocator

be obtained quickly by just removing the first element from the list.

buddy_alloc

Allocate a block of a certain size within the requested memory area. This first
rounds up the size to the nearest power of two, and then searches the
appropriate free list to see if there any available blocks of that size. If
there aren't, it looks at the free lists successfully larger block sizes until
it finds a free block. This block is then split repeatedly until a block of the
required size is obtained.

The memory returned by this function is always within the range associated with
the memarea structure, which ranges from ma->mem to ma->mem + 2^ma->upper.
Freeing this memory must only be done by calling buddy_free with the same
memarea structure.

through the wrapper functions kmalloc (for kernel memory) and malloc (for
process memory).

buddy_free


Release a region of memory that has previously been allocated by buddy_alloc.
Once this function has been called with a particular pointer, that pointer
becomes invalid, and should not be used again. It is up to the caller to ensure
that this restriction is complied with.

After marking the block as free, this function attempts to coalesce the blocks

no more coalescing is possible. These merges can result in larger block sizes
becoming available for subsequent allocation.

buddy_init

Initialise a memarea structure that is used by the buddy allocator to manage a
specific region of memory. The size of the region is specified as a power of
two, since the buddy allocation algorithm relies on the memory it is managing
being this size.

The blocks parameter is an array of blockinfo structures that are used to record
which parts of memory are used, and what block sizes they are part of. The
number of elements that this array must have depends on the size of the memory
being managed, and and can be calculated by calling the buddy_nblocks function.

The lower field of the memarea structure determines the granularity at which
memory is managed, which in turn affects the number of blockinfo structures that
are used. Smaller blocks potentially reduce the amount of wasted memory, but
require more memory to be set aside for the blocks array. We make a compromise
of 256 bytes of memory for every block element (1 byte). which means that this
is the smallest amount of memory that can be allocated. This value is defined
by the DEFAULT_LOWER macro near the top of this file.

init_userspace_malloc

Sets up the data segment of a process for use by malloc. The initial size of
the heap is specified here as a power of two, such that if this value is k then
the total heap size is 2^k. The data segment needs to hold this much memory,
plus some additional memory for the bookkepping data required by the buddy
allocation algorithm. This consists of a memarea structure, which is a fixed
size, as well as an array of blockinfo objects, which is a variable size based
on the size of the heap.

The brk system call is used by the process to request that the kernel modify
the end of the process's data segment to the specified address. This address is
calculated by taking the start of the data segment, and adding the total amount
of memory required for the heap as well as the bookkeeping data. Once this
memory has been obtained by the process, it can calculate the address of its
memarea structure and the blockinfo array, which are placed directly after the
heap. These are passed to buddy_init to set up the bookkeeping data so that
subsequent calls to buddy_alloc and buddy_free (called by malloc and free,
respectively) will work.

This function must be called at process startup, before main begins.
